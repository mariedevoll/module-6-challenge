# module-6-challenge
This is a mockup of my module 6 challenge, which was to create a weather dashboard using server-side APIs. 

You will see that the html, css, and javascript are functioning to accuratley call the weather forcast for any city that you choose and data for the week will also display, along with an icon for the rainy, cloudy, or sunny day.

Below is a preview of the deployed application:
